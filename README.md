## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict stock market prices. We analyze historical data from multiple assets (AMZN, DPZ, BTC, NFLX) to forecast future price movements, helping investors make data-driven decisions.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🔮 Multi-asset price prediction with LSTM networks
- 📊 Real-time visualization of training progress
- 📈 Comprehensive performance metrics and analysis
- 🧪 Interactive Jupyter notebook implementation
- 🔍 Robust data preprocessing pipeline
- 🤖 Advanced LSTM architecture with dropout layers

## 📈 Visualizations
